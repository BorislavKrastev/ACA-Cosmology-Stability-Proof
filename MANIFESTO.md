# ACA MANIFESTO v3: The Brane-Anchored Cosmos

We have identified the structural anchor of the universe. By resolving the de Sitter Swampland Crisis, Project ACA proves that our cosmological expansion is not a transient accident, but a stable geometric necessity.

### Core Discoveries:
1. **The Stability Valley:** A local minimum at $\phi \approx 10.1504$ where brane elasticity balances flux decay.
2. **The Krastev Constant ($C = 12.75858065006331$):** The precise measure of geometric resistance that stabilizes the vacuum.
3. **Eternal Inflation & Final Exit:** Our model supports Eternal Inflation in the Multiverse landscape, identifies our universe as a stable "pocket" that has achieved a graceful exit into a permanent de Sitter state.

Nature is not chaotic. It is structurally anchored.
